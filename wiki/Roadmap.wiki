=xPUD Development Roadmap=

==0.9.2==
  * backup installed opt packages
  * load backup (video, keymap, language and other settings) before starting X
  * connect connman with Plate through DBus Bridge, rewrite connection interface
  * fix shutdown scripts (stop daemons, hide unwanted warnings...)

==0.9.4==
  * indicate opt-get installation (e.g. show spinner animation while opt is being mounted)
  * disable install button for installed opt packages
  * rewrite update-menus script in Perl (speed improvements)
  * unified Plate UI settings system accessible by Plate and by scripts (currently using prefs.js, do we need better solution (JSON based conf file) or could we just improve the current one?)
  * automatically login as a non-root user
  * move home folder to e.g. /home/xpud
  * set locale information (LC_ALL)
  * set keymaps using setxkbmap (check Xvesa support)
  * pressing poweroff button should show shutdown dialog (use dbus bridge?)
  * multimedia keys support for most popular netbooks (sleep, volume, battery, wifi toggle)
  * improvements to get_video script (multiscreen support, on/off, rotation detection, saving settings to config to be loaded on startup (Xvesa))
  * keep translations in one file per language (easier to maintain)
  * alternative tasklist - application switcher (at least alt+tab between applications)

==0.9.x==
  * add alternative KDrive X servers (i810, nvidia, etc.)
  * Xvesa touchscreen calibration (libts, libts-bin, ts_calibrate || XCalibrate ?)
  * add virtual keyboard (xvkbd or matchbox-keyboard)
  * more ACPI events support for netbooks - sleep, lid close detect, wifi on/off etc.
  * improve time/date settings - timezone, am/pm, synchronization
  * custom local file manager (like KFM or ajaXplorer)
  * opt packages with application translations
  * bash script for normal HDD installation to a separate partition
  * improve sound settings - simplyfy, put playback and recording controls on different tabs
  * easy way to unmount plugged in devices (e.g. right click on an icon and choose eject)
  * show mounted devices in PCManFM sidebar
  * energy savings and automatic fan speed (e.g. acerfand script for Aspire One)

==1.0==
  * make all text strings in Plate localizeable
  * move all CSS style from templates to .css file, allowing Plate UI themes
  * improved boot menu (use gfx-boot) - fewer startup options, settings available from context menus. Boot options: Cloud (core with browser and flash), Multimedia (core, video player, codecs), Kiosk (address set from context menus), CLI (core, nox), Continue from Last Time (if backup exists).
  * user manual - quick overview of available functionality and settings (post on website)

==post 1.0==
  * fully modulized system - core, xvesa/xorg, plate/classic, apps, flash, etc. as separate images, user can mix and match available opt images to easily create their own system
